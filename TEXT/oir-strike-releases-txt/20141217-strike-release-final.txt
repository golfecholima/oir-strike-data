         An additional 45 strikes were conducted in support of the Peshmerga (KSF) and
Iraqi security forces operating in the region. Precision airstrikes from 15 coalition aircraft
destroyed approximately 50 targets, to include bulldozers, vehicles, checkpoints, enemy
fighting positions, enemy fighters, and equipment.

         All aircraft returned to base safely. Airstrike assessments are based on initial
reports.

         The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation
to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, the region and the
wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further
limits the terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations. Coalition
nations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include the U.S., Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, France, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Coalition Nations conducting
airstrikes in Syria include the U.S., Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
Emirates.
