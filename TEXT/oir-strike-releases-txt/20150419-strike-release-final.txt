                       Military Airstrikes Continue Against ISIL in Syria and Iraq
SOUTHWEST ASIA ­ Coalition military forces continued to attack ISIL terrorists in Syria and
Iraq between 8 a.m., April 18, and 8 a.m., April 19, local time. In Syria, Coalition military
forces conducted an airstrike using attack aircraft. Separately in Iraq, Coalition military forces
conducted 12 airstrikes approved by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense using fighter, attack and
remotely piloted aircraft against ISIL terrorists.

"We have witnessed continued, simultaneous successes on the ground in Iraq, most notably in
Northern Iraq," said Combined Joint Task Force Public Affairs Officer Col. Wayne Marotto.
"All of the coalition airstrikes reported today were dynamic in nature, directly supported forces
on the ground from Sinjar in the far North to Ramadi, in Central Iraq, and maintained the
ongoing degradation of ISIL."

     The following is a summary of the strikes conducted since the last press release:

     Near Bayji, three airstrikes struck two ISIL tactical units and two ISIL sniper positions.
     Near Fallujah, two airstrikes struck an ISIL large and smaller tactical unit, destroyed an

         ISIL anti-aircraft artillery weapon, an ISIL machine gun and three ISIL vehicles.
     Near Kirkuk, three airstrikes struck two ISIL large and one smaller tactical unit and

         destroyed three ISIL buildings.
     Near Ramadi, three airstrikes struck three ISIL tactical units, destroyed an ISIL structure,

         an ISIL fighting position and an ISIL mortar system.

eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, the region, and the wider
