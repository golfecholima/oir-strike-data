      Near Kobani, six airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and an ISIL fighting
         position and destroyed three ISIL vehicles, four ISIL buildings, three ISIL fighting
         positions, and two ISIL staging areas.

         Iraq

     Near Mosul, one airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit.

         The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation
to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, the region and the
wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further
limits the terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations. Coalition
nations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include the U.S., Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, France, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Coalition nations conducting
airstrikes in Syria include the U.S., Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
