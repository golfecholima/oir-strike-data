         ISIL culvert, and four ISIL roads, and destroyed an ISIL culvert and an ISIL
         vehicle.
     Near Ramadi, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL vehicle.
     Near Tal Afar, five airstrikes struck a large ISIL unit, two ISIL tactical units, an
         ISIL cantonment area, and an ISIL vehicle, and destroyed an ISIL building, six
         ISIL vehicles, an ISIL bunker, two ISIL shipping containers, and two ISIL
         checkpoints.
     Near Erbil, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL shipping container, two ISIL vehicles,
         and three ISIL earth moving vehicles.

         Airstrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base
safely.

         The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation
to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, the region,
and the wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq
further limits the terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations.
