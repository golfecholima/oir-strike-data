ISIL terrorists in Syria, using attack, bomber, and fighter aircraft to conduct 10 airstrikes.
Separately, U.S. and Coalition military forces conducted nine airstrikes in Iraq, using
attack, fighter, and remotely piloted aircraft against ISIL terrorists. All strikes took place
between 8 a.m., Jan. 19, and 8 a.m., Jan. 20, local time.

         The following is a summary of the strikes conducted since the last press release:

         Syria

     Near Kobani, nine airstrikes struck seven ISIL tactical units and destroyed four
         ISIL staging positions, five ISIL fighting positions, four ISIL vehicles, and an ISIL
         mortar system.

     Near Al Hasakah, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL bunker.

         Iraq

     Near Al Qaim, two airstrikes destroyed two ISIL armored vehicles.
     Near Al Asad, two airstrikes destroyed two ISIL fighting positions and two ISIL

         supply caches.
     Near Mosul, two airstrikes struck two ISIL tactical units and destroyed two ISIL

         mortar systems.
     Near Sinjar, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed an ISIL fighting

         position.
     Near Kirkuk, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit.
     Near Ramadi, an airstrike struck a large ISIL unit and destroyed three ISIL

         buildings and two ISIL heavy weapons.

    Airstrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base
safely.

    The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to
eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, the region, and
the wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq
further limits the terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations.
