Release # 20150410
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                    Military Airstrikes Continue Against ISIL in Syria and Iraq
SOUTHWEST ASIA ­ Coalition military forces continued to attack ISIL terrorists in Syria and
Iraq between 8 a.m., April 9, and 8 a.m., April 10, local time. In Syria, Coalition military forces
conducted seven airstrikes, using bomber, fighter and attack aircraft. Separately in Iraq, Coalition
military forces conducted nine airstrikes approved by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense using fighter,
attack and remotely piloted aircraft against ISIL terrorists.

     "The Syrian strikes support continued advances of Kurdish forces in the northern part of the
country" said Brig. Gen. Thomas Weidley, CJTF Chief of Staff. "Likewise, complementary
strikes in Iraq that support multiple on-going operations by the ISF and KSF, combine to produce
ever increasing lethal pressure on Daesh throughout both Syria and Iraq."

     The following is a summary of the strikes conducted since the last press release:

         Syria

     Near Al Hasakah, three airstrikes struck an ISIL large tactical unit and an ISIL tactical
         unit and destroyed four vehicles.

     Near Kobani, four airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed four ISIL fighting
         positions and two ISIL vehicles.

         Iraq

     Near Bayji, three airstrikes struck two ISIL tactical units and destroyed seven ISIL
         excavators and two ISIL vehicles.

     Near Fallujah, two airstrikes struck an ISIL IED position and destroyed an ISIL
         excavator.

     Near Hit in Al Anbar Province, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit.
     Near Mosul, two airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed an ISIL fighting

         position, an ISIL heavy machine gun and an ISIL excavator.
     Near Sinjar, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed three ISIL buildings

         and three ISIL fighting positions.

         Airstrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base safely.

                                        Operation Inherent Resolve

2-2-2
         The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to

eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, the region, and the wider
international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the
terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations. Coalition nations which have
conducted airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan,
Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States. Coalition nations which have conducted
airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Canada, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and
U.S.

         As a correction to the April 7 press release in which an airstrike near Aleppo was
described as striking an ISIL tactical unit, the tactical unit was part of a network of veteran al
Qaida operatives, sometimes called the "Khorasan Group," who are plotting external attacks
against the United States and our allies.
