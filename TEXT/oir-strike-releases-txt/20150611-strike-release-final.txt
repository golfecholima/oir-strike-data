FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

  Military Airstrikes Continue Against ISIL Terrorists in Syria and Iraq

SOUTHWEST ASIA ­ Coalition military forces continued to attack ISIL terrorists in Syria and
Iraq June 10. In Syria, coalition military forces conducted 16 airstrikes using attack, bomber and
fighter aircraft. Separately in Iraq, coalition military forces conducted 13 airstrikes approved by
the Iraqi Ministry of Defense using attack, bomber, fighter and remotely piloted aircraft against
ISIL terrorists.

     "Coalition aircrew professionalism continues to be the catalyst for successful strike
operations within the complex battlespace of Syria and Iraq where the combatant/civilian
distinction is blurred," said Brig. Gen. Thomas Weidley, CJTF-OIR chief of staff. "Aircrews, as
well as our Strike Approval Authorities, employ tactical patience, methodical procedures,
proportionality and process integrity as they execute their actions in accordance with the Law of
Armed Conflict."

Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States. Coalition nations which have conducted
airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Canada, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the
