FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                       Military Airstrikes Continue Against ISIL in Syria and Iraq
SOUTHWEST ASIA ­ Coalition military forces continued to attack ISIL terrorists in Syria and
Iraq between 8 a.m., April 12, and 8 a.m., April 13, local time. In Syria, Coalition military
forces conducted three airstrikes, using bomber and fighter aircraft. Separately in Iraq, Coalition
military forces conducted 14 airstrikes approved by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense using fighter,
attack and remotely piloted aircraft against ISIL terrorists.

     "These strikes on Daesh formations near Bayji reduce their numbers and limit their ability to
conduct operations," said Col. Wayne Marotto, CJTF-OIR Spokesman. "Coalition strikes
continue to degrade Daesh's capabilities across Iraq and Syria. We will continue to support the
ISF and the Government of Iraq against this threat."

     The following is a summary of the strikes conducted since the last press release:

         Syria

     Near Kobani, three airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit, destroyed five ISIL fighting
         positions and an ISIL vehicle.

         Iraq

     Near Al Huwayjah, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit.
     Near Bayji, six airstrikes struck six ISIL tactical units, destroyed an ISIL VBIED, an ISIL

         fighting position and an ISIL mortar system.
     Near Ramadi, four airstrikes destroyed seven ISIL buildings, an ISIL checkpoint and an

         ISIL fighting position.
     Near Sinjar, two airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit, destroyed two ISIL buildings and

         an ISIL heavy machine gun.
     Near Tal Afar, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit and two ISIL heavy machine guns.

         The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to
eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, the region, and the wider
international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the
terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations. Coalition nations which have
conducted airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan,
