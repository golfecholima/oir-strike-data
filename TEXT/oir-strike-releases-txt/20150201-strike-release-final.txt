         The following is a summary of the strikes conducted since the last press release:

     Near Hit, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit.
     Near Kirkuk, 19 airstrikes struck four large ISIL units and 11 ISIL tactical units

         and destroyed eight ISIL fighting positions, an ISIL staging position, eight ISIL
         vehicles, two ISIL armored vehicles, an ISIL building, and an ISIL tank.
     Near Mahkmur, an airstrike struck an ISIL tactical unit.
     Near Sinjar, two airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed two ISIL
         buildings, an ISIL heavy weapon, an ISIL shipping container, and an ISIL
         modular structure.
     Near Tal Afar, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL fighting position.

         Airstrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base
safely.

         The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation
to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, the region,
and the wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq
further limits the terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations.
