  Military Airstrikes Continue Against ISIL Terrorists in Syria and Iraq

SOUTHWEST ASIA ­ Coalition military forces continued to attack ISIL terrorists in Syria and
Iraq June 26. In Syria, coalition military forces conducted 14 airstrikes using attack, bomber,
fighter and remotely piloted aircraft. Separately in Iraq, coalition military forces conducted seven
airstrikes approved by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense using attack, fighter and remotely piloted
aircraft against ISIL terrorists.

     "Coalition airstrikes maintain pressure on Daesh across northern Syria, including their
stronghold in Ar Raqqah, Syria," said Brig. Gen. Thomas Weidley, CJTF-OIR chief of staff.
"Daesh's retreat at Tal Abyad, combined with defeats across northern Syria by anti-ISIL forces,
provides an assessment about Daesh credibility as an effective conventional fighting force."

    The following is a summary of the strikes conducted since the last press release:
