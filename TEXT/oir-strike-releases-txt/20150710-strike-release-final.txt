                                        Operation Inherent Resolve

     Near Sinjar, two airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit, and four ISIL staging areas

         machine gun, three ISIL vehicles and an ISIL building.

    Airstrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base safely.
    The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to eliminate
the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria and the wider international
community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the group's ability to
project terror and conduct operations. Coalition nations which have conducted airstrikes in Iraq
include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, Netherlands, United Kingdom and United
States. Coalition nations which have conducted airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Canada,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the U.S.

Separately, On July 8 near Idlib, Syria, coalition military forces conducted one airstrike against a
network of veteran al Qa'eda operatives, sometimes called the "Khorasan Group," who are
known to plot external attacks against the United States and our allies. The airstrike struck a
tactical unit and destroyed a vehicle.
